## Research Experience  

### Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate, Caltech  
*Sept. 2023 – Present*  
**Advisor**: Prof. Morteza Gharib ([mgharib@caltech.edu](mailto:mgharib@caltech.edu); [website](https://www.gharib.caltech.edu/))  
- Sparse and dynamic flow sensing and flight control using reinforcement learning, aiming to develop safer and more robust fixed-wing drones in extreme wind gusts.
- Organizing bi-weekly AI journal club.

### Fellow, Brown Technology Innovations  
*Aug. 2022 – Aug. 2023*  
**Advisor**: Mr. Brian Demers  
- Assessed the commercial potential of early-stage technologies, evaluated industry interest, developed marketing strategies, and composed technical reports and pitch documents.

*Jan. 2019 – Aug. 2023*  
**Advisor**: Prof. Kenneth Breuer ([kbreuer@brown.edu](mailto:kbreuer@brown.edu); [website](https://sites.brown.edu/breuerlab/))  
- Developed theoretical dynamical models with wing-body interaction, inertial and aerodynamic effects to predict motion of flapping wing flight and energetics.
- Investigated the energetics of animal flight under different flight speeds, highlighting the impact of wing camber on performance.
