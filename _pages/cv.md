Education
======
* B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering and Automation, South China University of Technology, Guangdong, China , 2014
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 2016 - 2017
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, Brown University, 2019 - 2023 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Aug. 2022 - Now: Innovation Fellow
  * Brown Technology Innovations Office, (https://www.brown.edu/research/conducting-research-brown/tech-innovations/brown-technology-innovations-staff)
  * Duties included: Assess the commercial potential of early-stage technologies, evaluate industry interest, develop marketing strategies, and compose technical reports and pitch documents.
  * Supervisor: Mr. Brian Demers

* Spring 2019 - Now: Research Assistant
  * Breuer Lab (https://sites.brown.edu/breuerlab/), in collaboration with Aeromechanics & Evolutionary Morphology Lab (https://www.brown.edu/Departments/EEB/EML/)
  * Duties included: 
       * Developed theoretical dynamical models with wing-body interaction, inertial and aerodynamic effect to predict the motion of flapping wing flight and energetics. 
       * Investigated the energetics of animal flight under different flight speeds, featuring the important effect of wing camber in performance.
       * Designed and fabricated robotic flapping wing platform to study unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon, which translates to efficient, quite drone with large payload capability.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Kenneth Breuer (kbreuer@brown.edu)
