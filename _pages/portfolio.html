Flapping wing robot Kestrel 

The plan of the ornithopter, called kestrel, was patented by an inventor called Andrew Kinkade, in the 2001. 
I built it as a hobby.
It weighs around 430 grams, and mounts a BLDC motor that drives the wing flapping up and down via a four-bar linkage mechanism.
There are two servos that controls the tail to pitch and roll

This video was taken on August, 25th, 2018, right in front of the lawn of the stadium inside Sichuan University. 
In this video, right after being ing, Kestrel descended intially, then I immediately increased the throttle, which effectively increased the flapping frequency.
It started to ascend, albeit slowly.

Then, I steered it to the right by pulling the tail. 
Towards the end of the video, the carbon rod snapped from the shoulder joint, potentially due to siginificant shear force at the base of the wing root.
