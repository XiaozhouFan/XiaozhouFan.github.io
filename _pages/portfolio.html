<h1>Flapping wing robot Kestrel </h1>

        The plan of the ornithopter, called kestrel, was patented by an inventor called Andrew Kinkade, in the 2001. 
        I built it as a hobby.
        It weighs around 430 grams, and mounts a BLDC motor that drives the wing flapping up and down via a four-bar linkage mechanism.
        There are two servos that controls the tail to pitch and roll

        This video was taken on August, 25th, 2018, in front of a lawn of the stadium in Sichuan University, China
        In this video, right after launching, Kestrel started to descend, then I immediately increased the throttle, which effectively increased the flapping frequency.
        It started to ascend, albeit slowly.

        Then, I steered it to the right by controling the tail surface to roll to right. 
        Towards the end of the video, the carbon rod snapped from the shoulder joint, potentially due to siginificant shear force at the base of the wing root.
