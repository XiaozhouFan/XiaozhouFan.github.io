Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate, Caltech Sept. 2023 – Now
Advisor: Prof. Morteza Gharib (mgharib@caltech.edu); https://www.gharib.caltech.edu/
* Sparse and dynamic flow sensing and flight control using reinforcement learning, aiming to develop safer and more robust fixed-wing drones in extreme wind gust.
* Organizing bi-weekly AI journal club.

* Aug. 2022 - Aug. 2023: Innovation Fellow
  * [Brown Technology Innovations Office](https://www.brown.edu/research/conducting-research-brown/tech-innovations/brown-technology-innovations-staff)
  * Duties included: Assess the commercial potential of early-stage technologies, evaluate industry interest, develop marketing strategies, and compose technical reports and pitch documents.
  * Supervisor: Mr. Brian Demers

* Jan. 2019 - Aug. : Research Assistant
  * [Breuer Lab](https://sites.brown.edu/breuerlab/), in collaboration with [Aeromechanics & Evolutionary Morphology Lab](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/EEB/EML/)
  * Duties included: 
       * Developed theoretical dynamical models with wing-body interaction, inertial and aerodynamic effect to predict the motion of flapping wing flight and energetics. 
       * Investigated the energetics of animal flight under different flight speeds, featuring the important effect of wing camber in performance.
       * Designed and fabricated robotic flapping wing platform to study unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon, which translates to efficient, quite drone with large payload capability.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Kenneth Breuer (kbreuer@brown.edu)

* Jan. 2016 - Dec.2017: Research Assistant
  * [HPCFD Lab](https://hpcfd.me.vt.edu/)
  * Duties included: 
       * Devised an algorithm, and ported this into the in-house N-S incompressible solver GenIDLEST, such that the bat wing at each discretized time was represented as a thin surface in the immersed boundary method (IBM) framework.
       * Devised a mathematical formulation that decomposed the highly articulated bat wing kinematics into five canonical descriptors (flapping, stroke-plane deviation, twisting, chord- and span-wise cambering), and performed CFD simulations (LES) on systemically simplified kinematics and analyzed the flow field.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Danesh Tafti (dtafti@exchange.vt.edu)

* May. 2016– Sept. 2016, Research Assistant
  *  [VT-SDU lab](https://www.nature.com/nature-index/institution-outputs/china/shandong-university-virginia-tech-international-laboratory/5d678d6547484108b33eb9ac)
  *  Duty included: Participation in the construction of a flight tunnel and motion capturing experiment of bats flight.
  *  Supervisor: Prof. Rolf Muller (rolf.mueller@vt.edu) 

* Dec. 2011–Nov. 2013, National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, China.
  * Duty included: Designed a flapping wing mechanism that mimicked the birds’ or bats’ folding of wings during the upstroke, and completed its mathematical modelling and preliminary efficiency analysis.
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Xianmin Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x0cieSsAAAAJ&hl=en) (zhangxm@scut.edu.cn),
